## 1 Introduction

In this tutorial, you will build a Mendix questionnaire app that extends SAP SuccessFactors.

You want to launch a questionnaire for your employees, with job-related questions. When the employees complete the questionnaire, they get a score, and their profile in SAP SuccessFactors is updated with the score. You can then track your employees' performance and identify topics that needs improvement.

**The score property in the Employee entity of SAP SuccessFactors was created in advance using the SAP SuccessFactors Extension Framework (MDF).**

You will create the app using pre-built components, and use the SAP OData Connector to connect to the SAP SuccessFactors system. More specifically, you will learn how to:

* Enhance the data-model
* Build a page
* Implement logic to retrieve the score from SAP SuccessFactors and update it with the new score
* Deploy the app to SAP Cloud Platform from the Mendix modeler

## 2 Prerequisites

You are provided with all the information and software which you need to perform this tutorial.

## 3 Creating the Mendix App

Firstly, you need to create a new Mendix app and an SAP environment where you can run it.

<!-- this step not needed? I'll leave it in, just in case we need to reinstate it

1.  Click **Create App** in the top-right of the Mendix Developer Portal.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image1.png)

-->

1.  Click **SAP Apps**.

2.  Click the picture of the **Blank App** (with Atlas UI).

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image2.png)

3.  Click **Use this app**.

4.  Enter *Employee Questionnaire* and click **Create App**.
 
	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image3.png)

## 4 Setting Up SAP Cloud Platform

Now you need to tell SAP where the app will run.

1.  Select your SAP region and click **Next**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image4.png)

2.  Select your **Organization** and **Space** from the selection offered.

3.  Leave the database options on their default and click **Create**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image5.png)

An environment (SAP Cloud Platform application) will be created on SAP Cloud Platform. This will attach all the services needed to run the Mendix application (database, route, user authentication and so forth).

## 5 Modeling the Mendix App

Now you are ready to start implementing the app using visual modeling.

### 5.1 Importing Required Modules into the Mendix App

Some of the app has been written already, so you need to import those pieces into your app.

1.  Click **Edit App** on the top-right corner of the Developer Portal.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image6.png)

	This makes a local copy of your app and loads it into the Mendix Desktop Modeler.

2.	Click **Open VersionSelector** when asked.

3.  Click **Open with selected Modeler version** to confirm that you want to edit the app in your current version of the Desktop Modeler (version 7.17.2).

4.  Click *Or sign in with...* **SAP** and sign in with your SAP credentials.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image7.png)

5.  Click the App Store icon (the shopping basket) in the Desktop Modeler.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image8.png)

6.  Enter *Questionnaire* in the search box and click the magnifying glass.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image9.png)

7.  Click **Read more**.

8.  Click **Download** to add the module to your project.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image10.png)

9.  Click **Import** to confirm that you want to import the module.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image11.png)

10.  Repeat steps 3 through 7 to find and download the **SAP Teched 2018 - SuccessFactors Employee** module.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image12.png)

11.  You can see the two modules you have imported, along with other modules, by expanding the tree structure in the **Project Explorer**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image13.png)

The **Questionnaire** module allows you to design questionnaires and allows users to run them. The **Employee** module supports the SAP SuccessFactors employee object with a Domain Model, app Pages, and logic. You will now extend this to link the questionnaires to the employees and use SAP SuccessFactors to record the results.

### 5.2 Modifying App Navigation

Mendix apps work by showing pages to the user. You can define which page should be the Home page: the first page the user sees. Each page in your Mendix app can also have a menu bar. You define which pages appear in this menu.

1.  Right-click **Project 'Employee Questionnaire' > Navigation** and click **Open**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image14.png)

2.  Click **Select...** next to **Default home page.**

3.  Enter *login* in the **Filter**.

4.  Select **App Store modules > Employee > Login** as the new home page.

5.  Click **Select**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image15.png)

6.  Click the **Home** page in the **Menu** section of the **Navigation**.

7.  Click **Edit**.

8.  Click **Select** next to **Page.**

9.  Select the **Login** page using the filter.

10. Click **Select**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image16.png)

11. Click **OK** to confirm the change.
    
    Currently, the user can take a questionnaire, but there is no way that anyone can set up new questionnaires. While you are changing the navigation, you can add new items to the appâ€™s menu. The instructions below add a menu item which will allow an administrator to login and create a new questionnaire.

12. Click **Menu > New item**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image17.png)

13. Enter *Config* as the **Caption**.

14. Select *cog* as the **Icon**.

15. Select *Show a page* as **On click**.

16. Select *Employee.AdminLogin* as **Page**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image18.png)

The Navigation will now look like this:

![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image19.png)

### 5.3 Updating the Domain Model

The **Employee** entity in the employee module represents the employee stored in SAP SuccessFactors. To link the Employee to a Questionnaire we need to create a relation between the Questionnaire entity and the Employee entity.

1.  Use the **Go To** function of the Mendix Desktop Modeler by pressing Ctrl+G or using the menu option **Edit > Go to ...**.

2.  Select the **Questionnaire (Questionnaire)** *entity* and click **Go to**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image20.png)

3.  Right-click the **Questionnaire** entity (on the entity name).

4.  Click **Add > Association**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image21.png)

5.  Select **App Store modules > Employee > Employee** and click **Select**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image22.png)

You can see the new association (Questionnaire_Employee) represented in the Domain Model:

![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image23.png)

### 5.4 Modifying Logic

Now that you have an association between Questionnaire and Employee you can set a relation between a questionnaire and the current user. You do this when the user starts a new questionnaire.

The business logic of the app is recorded in **microflows**. When a user starts a new questionnaire the **SUB_ConductConfiguration** in the **Employee** module is initiated. You are going to extend this microflow so that it sets the relation between the current Employee and the new Questionnaire.

1.  Use the **Go To** function (see above) to find the **SUB_ConductConfiguration** microflow.

2.  Click **Go to**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image24.png)

3.  Click the **Toolbox** tab in the right-hand panel to open the toolbox.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image25.png)

4.  Drag a **Change object** action between **Create Questionnaire** and **Retrieve Page from database**.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image26.png)

5.  Double-click the **Change** action you have just created.

6.  Select the **Variable** *NewQuestionnaire (Questionnaire.Questionnaire)*. This is the new questionnaire which has been created.

7.  Click **New**.

8.  Select the **Member** *Questionnaire.Questionnaire_Employee (Employee.Employee)*. This is the association between the questionnaire and an employee.

9.  Set the **Value** to *$Employee*. This is the employee who is currently taking the questionnaire.

	![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image27.png)

10. Click **OK** to confirm the changes, then **OK** again.

The result looks like this:

![](attachments/modify-a-mendix-questionnaire-for-sap-successFactors-teched-2018/media/image28.png)

### 5.5 Working with Pages

You will now create a page which is shown when the user has finished a questionnaire. It will show the score received and allow the employee to update this in the SAP SuccessFactors system.

1.  Right-click on the **Employee** module and select **Add page...** to add a page to the Employee module.
