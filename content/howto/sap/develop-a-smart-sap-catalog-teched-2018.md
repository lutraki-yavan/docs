## 1 Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to develop a Mendix app which uses, as its source, data which is held on an SAP back-end system.

You will create an app to maintain a catalog of products which integrates seamlessly with the SAP S/4 system. The app will support the admin and user roles.

You will then add the ability to search the catalog using SAP Leonardo Machine Learning image classification.

Specifically, you will learn how to:

* Create a Mendix app based on a template
* Generate the app’s domain model based on an OData service coming from an SAP S/4 system
* Set up Mendix so that you can consume an SAP OData service using pre-built components from the Mendix App Store
* Adding more functionality to your app by modeling in Mendix
* Make your app ‘smart’ by leveraging the SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation Connector
* Set security in your app
* Deploy your app to SAP Cloud Platform

## 2 Prerequisites

You are provided with all the information and software which you need to perform this tutorial.

## 3 Starting a New SAP App

The first step is to create a Mendix app. You need to link this to SAP Cloud Platform so that you can run the app there.

1.  Choose the **Blank App** with Atlas UI styling.

    ![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image1.png)

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image3.png)

## 4 Creating an SAP Cloud Platform Environment

SAP needs to know exactly which region, account, subaccount, and space you will be using to deploy this app. Mendix will take you through the process step-by-step.

Depending on whether you have used SAP from Mendix before, and whether you are currently signed in to SAP you may have to log in to SAP and confirm that SAP and Mendix can share information about the app.

1.  Select the **Region** of your SAP account.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image4.png)

1.  Click **Next**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image5.png)

1.  Select your **Domain**, **Organization** (subaccount), and **Space**. You will only be able to select options which are accessible to your account.

1.  Select No for Custom Database?.

1.  Leave the **Postgress-v9.4-dev** \[sic\] database selected.

1.  Click **Create**.
    
    ![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image6.png)

    SAP now creates the environment for you, with all the runtime resources which are needed by your app.

    You are shown a confirmation page and can now edit your app.

    ![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image7.png)

![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image12.png)

## 5 Creating an OData Data Model for the Product Management OData service

You are going to use a product catalog which is held in an SAP S/4HANA system. These have been exposed via an OData service called **EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV** which its metadata file is provided in the session folder in the *student share*.

Your Mendix app needs to know the details of the EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV OData service before you can get data from it. You do this by creating a data model using the SAP OData Model Creator in the Mendix App Store.

1.  Open the SAP OData Model Creator App Store page ([<span class="underline">https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/105622/</span>](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/105622/)) in your browser.

1. Click **Open** to start the SAP OData Model Creator.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image13.png)

1. Click **Manual** as the source for the API.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image14.png)

1. Select the $metadata.xml file in the session folder in the *student share* and click **OK**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image15.png)

1. Click Continue.

1. Select the EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV schema and click **Continue**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image16.png)

1. Click **Generate .mpk**.

1. Once the generation is complete, the **Download** button appears.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image17.png)

1. Click **Download** to save the file on your local drive.

## 6 Importing the Data Model into your App

You now have all the information which Mendix needs to get your data out of the SAP back-end using the EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV OData service. Now all you have to do is to import it into your Smart Catalog app, so that you can use it there.

1.  Return to your *Smart Catalog* app in the Desktop Modeler.

1. Right-click the project name and choose **Import module package...**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image18.png)

1. Find the module file you have just generated with the SAP OData Model Creator.

1. Click **Open**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image19.png)

1. Select **Add as a new module** and click **Import**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image20.png)

Your module will now be part of your Project:

![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image21.png)

## 7 Importing Required Modules into the Mendix App

Some of the app has been written already, so you need to import those pieces into your app.

1.  Click the App Store icon (the shopping basket) in the Desktop Modeler.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image22.png)

1. Enter *Catalog* in the search box and click the magnifying glass.

1. Click **Read more** next to *SAP TechEd 2018 - Smart Catalog*.

1. Click **Delete** to delete this navigation profile.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image33.png)

## 9 Retrieving Data from SAP S/4HANA

The **SmartCatalogExercise** module comes with no products. You need to replace a retrieve from the local database with an OData **Get** action against the **EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV** service.

1.  Press Ctrl + G to open the **Go To** dialog.

1. Search for the microflow **IVK_SearchProduct**.

1. Click **Go to**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image34.png)

1. Click the action Create list of Product.

1. Press Delete to delete this action.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image35.png)

1. Click the **Toolbox** tab in the right-hand pane to switch to the microflow toolbox.
    
    ![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image36.png)

1. Drag an SAP OData Connector > Create request params into the microflow.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image37.png)

1. Double-click the **Create request params** action to open the properties.

1. Enter *Parameters* as **Variable** name.

1. Click **OK**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image38.png)

1. Drag an **SAP OData Connector > Add basic authentication** action after the **Create request params** action in the microflow.

1. Double-click this new action.

1. Select **$Parameters** as the **Request parameters**.

1. Click **Edit...** next to **Username**.

1. Enter **@sm**.

1. Click **@SmartCatalogExercise.BE_User (String)** to select it.
    
    (This is a constant containing a user for the S/4HANA system which has been set up in advance).

1. Press Enter to confirm your selection. (Check that the full name of the parameter appears in the dialog).

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image39.png)

1. Click **OK**.

1. Repeat steps 14 through 17 to set **Password** to *@SmartCatalogExercise.BE_UserPassword (String)*. This is the password for the user which was set up on the S/4HANA system.

1. Select *No* for **User return variable**.

1. Click **OK** to confirm the basic authentication action.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image40.png)

1. Drag **SAP OData Connector > Get list** action after the **Add basic authentication** action in the microflow.

1. Double-click on the **Get list** action.

1. Click **Edit...** next to the **Query**.

1. Enter (or copy and paste) the following query in the Edit box.

    ```
    @EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV.EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV + '/' + toString (EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV.EntitySetNames.Products) + '/?$filter=substringof(SubCategoryName,''' + urlEncode($SearchCriteria/Term) + ''')'
    ```

    This is the OData query which retrieves a list of products which contain the search term which is entered on the product list page. The first part of the query identifies the SAP S/4HANA service list of products. This is then filtered to only return products where the search term appears in the product's SubCategoryName.

1. Click **OK**.

1. Click **Select...** next to the **Response type**.

1. Search for *Product*.

1. Select **EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV > Product**.

1. Click **Select**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image41.png)

## 12 Setting Security in your App

To deploy the app to SAP Cloud Platform and use the SAP Cloud Connector the security has to be set correctly. If the app is deployed with no security, it is not possible to use SAP credentials to logon and you cannot use non-public endpoints via the SAP Cloud Connector.

1.  Double-click **Project \`Smart Catalog' > Security** in the Project Explorer.

1.  Click **Prototype / demo**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image83.png)

    You now need to set the *User role* **User** to have access to all the modules you have added to the app.

1. Click the **User roles** tab.

1. Select the role named **User**.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. Click **Edit** for **Module roles**.

1. Activate the **User** role for all the modules by clicking the tick boxes. The modules you need to change are:

    * LeonardoMachineLearning
    * SmartCatalogExercise

## 13 Deploying and Configuring Your App

You have tested your app running on your local machine. It is now time to deploy your app to SAP Cloud Platform. This will allow you to share your app with other users and utilize features such as SAP single sign-on and SAP Cloud Connector.

### 13.1 Deploying Your App

1.  Click the arrow next to **Run Locally**.

1. Click **Run**.

	![](attachments/develop-a-smart-sap-catalog-teched-2018/media/image87.png)

This will deploy your app to SAP Cloud Platform.

### 13.2 Configuring Your App

Because this is the first time you have deployed your app, there are a couple of items which need to be configured from within the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit.

#### 13.2.1 Configuring Single Sign On

No users have been given access to your app, so you need to add them.

1.  Return to the browser tab with the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit open. If you have this, jump to step 4.

1. Open the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit here: https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit.

1. Log On with your student credentials, if required.

1. Click **Home...** if you are not on the home page.
